### LD 51 - Da Bomb!

----

Your crew have boarded the ISS Last Dab. The ship has been overrun by crazed crew members, infected by a cannibalistic virus. Your mission is to gain control of the ships systems through various terminals. Use your crew's unique abilities to your advantage. However, the virus is taking hold, and only one is able to think for 10 seconds before needing rest. Good luck!

### The Crew

Sgt. Hot Pepper - Ex-Military special forces, useless at complex tasks, but packs quite a punch in a brawl.

Dave the Engineer: His quick reactions allow him to perform well under high pressure tasks, his spanner isn't too bad for hitting zombies too.

Dr Ronald Reaper - The smartest man left alive, his massive brain excels at memory tasks
but he is not as young as he once was and struggles to keep up with the rest of the group.
Would lose an arm wrestle to a baby.

Da Bomb - Who knows how he got into this mess but he finds himself with a bomb strapped to his chest,
as a result he runs around like a headless chicken and has no focus when attempting to complete tasks.
One thing for sure, don't let him die as the explosion will kill you all.

### The Tasks
Panel Passcode - Memorise then reinsert the pattern that appears on the screen to solve this task

Energy Flux - Test of your reaction time, press the button when the energy pulsar is in the green zone to complete


Remember you're never safe from the zombies, both you and your friends are most at risk when you are in the terminal.
